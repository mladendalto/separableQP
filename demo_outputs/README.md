# Demo outputs

Figures generated by `demo_separable_qp_layer.py` are saved here. The updated plotting utilities consolidate related views into single panels, clarify axes, and use informative titles that include batch/feature counts and the target sum constraint.

Key files generated by the demo script:

- `simplex_value_panels.png`, `simplex_sorted_profiles_panel.png`, and `simplex_support_topk_panel.png`: compare simplex-style projection to softmax with clear axes, combined quantile/support overlays, and a support-size / top-k summary.
- `khot_value_panels.png` and `khot_support_topk_panel.png`: visualize relaxed k-hot gating with summed-mass annotations.
- `adaptive_xi_curve.png` and `adaptive_xi_value_hist_logy.png`: show how the learnable sum constraint moves mass and sparsity.
- `learn_bounds_*`: before/after bound distributions, widths, and loss curves for the learnable-bounds toy fit.
- `gamma_group_mass_compare.png`: group-mass comparison across heterogeneous curvature settings.
- `contour_n2_geometry.png`: 2D contour plot with the feasible segment and projected solution highlighted.

Run `python demo_separable_qp_layer.py` to refresh the figures.
